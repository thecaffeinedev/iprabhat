Before jumping into a little background about me, I am a software engineer having almost 2 years of experience. 

Over time I have given many tech interviews and also asked so many people about their tech interview experience.  And this blog post is about asking the right questions to your potential employer before accepting the job offer. This post is summed up by my own experience, my peers, and my seniors in tech.

Sooner or later, after college most of us starts looking for a new job. Reasons can be different. Maybe good salary expectations or maybe you want to learn more and or maybe get more responsibilities. Reason maybe anything and it's fine.

Generally, you go to any job portal and search for open positions in many companies around us. And if you get short-listed, they start the interview process. And it mainly focuses on evaluating your skills. Problem-solving skills, Technical skills, communication skills, leadership skills, and so on.

The only problem is that after so many rounds of the technical interviews talking about DS/Algo, scalability, good code writing, computer science fundamentals, etc. It takes weeks or maybe sometimes a month or two to get over the interview. 

You need to remember that not every company is FAANG. Many people go for different MNC's, mid-size companies, startups, and all. And after even those rounds,  you join the company and see that processes are bad, architecture is not good enough, the tech stack is not up to date, teammates are not motivated, no team spirit is there, not getting assigned to the project according to your skillsets, etc. There are many.

This doesn’t happen everywhere but maybe in some cases people face these issues. I have heard from many seniors and other developers complaining.

To prevent that situation from happening, you should turn the interview process into a two-way conversation. Take the initiative and ask your questions, questions that are important for you. 

In my case, I always look out for these things in a company: 

- Company's Product Vision
- Technical Vision
- Team & Engineering culture

And these things helps me evaluate whether the company is good or not.

So let's go over each of those and you will get the idea.
