## Personal Website

This is a static site powering my blog built using Jekyll, Markdown and some JS.

## Quick start
```
https://github.com/TheCaffeineDev/iprabhat.git
cd prabhat
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Navigate to `localhost:4000`. You're Welcome, Fork and be Stargazer.

## Limitation

- Since [`jekyll-postfiles`](https://github.com/nhoizey/jekyll-postfiles#compatibility) plugin isn't supported by github pages, this cause will make your site problems, path broken or post images won't show up, you can host alternatively using likes [netlify.com](https://netlify.com), [vercel.com](https://vercel.com), [azure.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/publish-jekyll) or [surge.sh](https://surge.sh) services, which support 3rd party.
