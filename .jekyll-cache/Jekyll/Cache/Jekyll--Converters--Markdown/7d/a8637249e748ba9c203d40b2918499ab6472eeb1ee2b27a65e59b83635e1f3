<p>I have been into this programming field since my college days and I have tried a lot of editors over time. As a developer, I believe a code editor is one of the most important tool that a developer can have.</p>

<p>Before I was happy with Sublime Text and Atom for most of the part because it could do everything I needed in my tech stack.</p>

<p>I switched to VS Code for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Git integration</strong>: I actually prefer to use Terminal for anything to do with Git but the VS Code git system is really great.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrated terminals</strong>: You get a complete terminal emulator, out of the box.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed &amp; Extensions:</strong> VS Code is not as fast as Sublime Text but it feels faster than Atom. It has thousands of extensions available that cover pretty much every use case I can think of.</li>
  <li><strong>IntelliSense:</strong> Intellisense is incredible.VS Code has more intelligent language support, autocompletion, and suggestion. Itâ€™s super helpful, sometimes I donâ€™t have to look up various functions and methods.</li>
  <li><strong>Completely Free:</strong> It is open source and updates are very much frequent.</li>
</ol>

<p>And thereâ€™s more.</p>

<p>Anyway, this blog post is about how to run VS Code in your browser. I am using Ubuntu 18.04 btw. Ubuntu 20.04 will also work fine.</p>

<p>First go to this URL</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/">Code server releases</a> and download the binary file for Linux.</p>

<p>Then unzip it.</p>

<p>Then go inside the unzipped folder.</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/732/1*ehQhkcBsbCOmv_mH86e_Zw.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Inside that folder, the code-server is the binary file and you can run it by</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./code-server
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see itâ€™s running on my localhost.</p>

<p>If you want your own password, you can add your own password by</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>PASSWORD=prabhat ./code-server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/727/1*f5MZua0HuUodU35Epy2ULA.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can change your port if you want to.</p>

<p>Then you have to go to your local address. In my case itâ€™s</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>http://127.0.0.1:8080/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It will ask you to enter your password.</p>

<p><img src="./code-server-login.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After entering your password, you will see your code server up and running.</p>

<p><img src="./code-server.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So thatâ€™s it.</p>

<p>I do use the desktop based VSCode for day-to-day coding purpose. But sometimes when needed, running VS code on my browsers saves me time and makes me more productive.</p>

<p>And I think a code editor is simply a tool. It doesnâ€™t matter whether you choose Sublime Text or VS Code or any other. What matters is it works for you.</p>
